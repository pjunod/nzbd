//! Seq-stamped engine events with a replay ring (INTEGRATION_PLAN N2).
//!
//! The engine's broadcast channel is lossy by design: a slow subscriber is
//! dropped rather than allowed to stall the queue owner. That is the right
//! trade for a UI, and the wrong one for a consumer that imports things —
//! a monarr that blinks at the wrong moment used to have no way to know it
//! had missed a completion, let alone which one.
//!
//! This module fixes that without changing the engine's channel. One pump
//! task subscribes to the engine, stamps every event with a monotone `seq`
//! and keeps the last [`RING`] of them. SSE connections read from the ring
//! (for `Last-Event-ID` replay) and then follow the live fan-out. Because
//! exactly one task does the stamping, every consumer sees the same
//! numbers in the same order — which is the entire point of the id.
//!
//! Two things this deliberately does NOT do:
//!
//! * It does not persist. `seq` is process-lifetime and restarts at 1.
//!   The wire id is therefore `<boot>-<seq>`, where `boot` is unique to
//!   this process: a bare seq cannot tell "you missed events 51-60" from
//!   "we restarted and these are a *different* events 51-60", and the
//!   second one served as a clean resume is silent corruption of a
//!   consumer's view. `Last-Event-ID` is opaque to SSE, so carrying the
//!   epoch in it costs nothing; the plain `seq` still rides in the body
//!   for consumers that want an ordering.
//! * It does not make SSE reliable enough to depend on. The ring is a
//!   convenience over the real recovery path (`?since_seq=` on history).
//!   A client that ignores `reset` and trusts the stream is still wrong.
