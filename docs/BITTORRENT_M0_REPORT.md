# BitTorrent M0 report — stable `librqbit` proves the data path, not the ownership contract

**Status:** complete; no-go for daemon integration · **Run:** 2026-08-05 ·
**Engine:** `librqbit =8.1.1`, `default-features = false`, `rust-tls` ·
**Host:** macOS 26.6 arm64 · **Decision owner:** ADR-19 in
[BITTORRENT_PROPOSAL.md](BITTORRENT_PROPOSAL.md)

The isolated spike proves that stable `librqbit` can download and seed nzbd’s
first-release v1/TCP/IPv4 workload. It does **not** yet justify wiring a torrent
session into the daemon. Two public-API gaps break accepted proposal contracts:

1. enabling fast-resume persistence automatically restores every library
   record during session construction, before nzbd can reconcile its durable
   job store; and
2. public per-torrent stats do not expose tracker/DHT health or the last
   tracker error required for honest stalled-state reporting.

The implementation therefore stops at the isolated `nzbd-torrent` boundary
and queue schema-version groundwork. No config switch, API, daemon dependency,
peer listener, or production torrent admission path has been added.

The [pre-release operations review](BITTORRENT_RELEASE_REVIEW.md) collects the
current traffic, port, path, seeding, deletion, evidence, and sign-off contract
without presenting any of those proposed settings as usable production
behavior.

A later hostile-input review found a third stable-engine prerequisite outside
the two failed ownership/observability gates: magnet metadata is allocated up
to rqbit's fixed 32 MiB ceiling before nzbd can apply its proposed 10 MiB
default. Section 3.5 records the upstream candidate that moves a caller's
limit ahead of that allocation. This does not change gates 7 or 8 and does not
authorize production wiring.

## 1. Result against the eleven gates

| Gate | Result | Evidence and consequence |
|---:|---|---|
| 1. Rust 1.85 and platform packaging | **Pass** | A real Rust 1.85.1 macOS build passes, and the release harness links only macOS system libraries, not OpenSSL. The first checked-in `BitTorrent M0` run caught Tokio 1.53.0 using Rust 1.86's `OnceLock::wait` on Windows. After the workspace pinned Tokio 1.52.4, the [corrected run completed successfully](https://github.com/pjunod/nzbd/actions/runs/31060326800) on 2026-08-06 UTC: the isolated adapter suite passed on Linux glibc, macOS arm64, Windows MSVC, and x86-64/aarch64 musl under Rust 1.85, and the exact-engine/Rust-TLS dependency policy also passed. |
| 2. v1 `.torrent`, magnet, TCP/IPv4, then seed | **Pass** | Deterministic generated payloads download through both admission paths; a local seeder accounts for both uploads and exact bytes match. The adapter checks nonzero piece length and total payload, checked aggregate length, whole SHA-1 hash width, exact hash count, and rqbit's `u32` absolute chunk-index boundary before the engine constructs its length table. |
| 3. Controls and live limits | **Pass** | Pause/resume is exercised before completion, the live download limit is removed during transfer, and idempotent keep-data delete, idempotent delete-data, and unrelated-sibling retention pass. |
| 4. Kill/restart never trusts partial data | **Blocked** | The accepted fast-resume design cannot be constructed without failing gate 8. A persistence-disabled full hash recheck is a possible safe but slower product decision, not an equivalent test of the accepted design. |
| 5. Private-torrent discovery | **Pass** | A one-tracker private torrent downloads through a loopback HTTP tracker, and a deterministic peer-wire control proves public torrents consume an injected PEX peer while private torrents ignore it. A Linux capture harness starts live DHT, redirects both stable-8.1.1 bootstrap ports to a local KRPC probe, and observes separate public control hashes before and during a 15-second private canary window. It scans all captured UDP—not just redirected DHT—for the private hash in binary or LSD-style text form. The [first successful capture run](https://github.com/pjunod/nzbd/actions/runs/31128106994) passed on 2026-08-06 UTC: both DHT controls were observed and no private DHT/LSD hash appeared. Tracker order is still lost through a hash set before truncation, so the adapter rejects private metainfo unless it has exactly one unique tracker. Empty tracker slots are treated as absent; every non-empty tracker URL now fails closed before rqbit can silently discard malformed/non-UTF-8 input, unsupported schemes, missing hosts, or UDP without a port. A magnet does not expose the private bit before resolution; because stable rqbit has no per-add DHT suppression, the adapter rejects every magnet in a DHT-enabled session before calling the engine. A known-private `.torrent` is likewise rejected before engine admission when session DHT is live. Loopback and policy tests prove both guards fail before contact while DHT-disabled private admission remains available. |
| 6. Path and delete safety | **Pass** | The adapter now repeats the portable lexical path invariant before rqbit admission: unnamed payloads, empty/dot/parent components, slash or backslash, absolute/UNC forms, Windows drive prefixes and device aliases, alternate-data-stream and other reserved characters, trailing dot/space aliases, malformed UTF-8, empty multi-file paths, missing/unsafe multi-file roots, metainfo-declared symlinks, exact duplicate paths, file-versus-directory-prefix overlaps, and portable Unicode NFC/full-case-fold collisions fail with safe nzbd-owned errors. Greek sigma, long-s, Windows dotless-i, compatibility-ligature, and sharp-s/full-fold aliases are covered without collapsing compatibility-only width pairs. rqbit's shared `torrent-content` fallback is therefore never used for an unnamed single-file torrent. Magnet input first resolves through rqbit's list-only path, which returns before storage construction; nzbd then applies the same metainfo contract and admits only the validated bytes. A fake BEP 9 peer proves an unsafe resolved path leaves the destination empty, and the real-admission corpus still proves rejection before an escape file exists. The session canonicalizes its output root and preflights every existing payload prefix with no-follow metadata: symlinks fail, prefixes must be directories, and leaves must be regular files while an existing regular leaf remains valid resume input. A Unix test proves a symlink is rejected before storage and its external target remains empty. The [first cross-platform filesystem-probe run](https://github.com/pjunod/nzbd/actions/runs/31240896567) passed on 2026-08-08 UTC for ASCII-case and Unicode NFC/NFD pairs. The [review-correction native run](https://github.com/pjunod/nzbd/actions/runs/31264422471) passed on 2026-08-08 UTC after proving default macOS storage also aliases compatibility ligatures and full-case-fold pairs; the adapter now rejects those pairs. The native matrix records all four rejected classes and requires the remaining compatibility-width pair that the adapter admits to stay distinct. The exact observations are recorded in §2.2. They describe hosted temporary volumes, not every operator payload mount. This is defense in depth, not a claim to close the check/write race. The importer-safe content inventory omits BEP 47 padding entries while raw engine-indexed progress remains available only as diagnostics. Delete-data removes only parsed torrent content; an unrelated sibling survives. Higher layers must still prove persisted delete-root authority, descriptor-relative containment across writes, and empirical filesystem-specific behavior across supported operator payload mounts in M5/M2. |
| 7. Public observability | **Fail** | Public stats expose phase, total/progress/upload bytes, file progress, rates, ETA inputs, peer counts, completion, and error. Stable 8.1.1 does not expose per-torrent tracker state, DHT state, or last tracker error. A tested upstream patch now supplies that snapshot, but this gate remains failed until an accepted stable release contains it. “No peers” cannot safely substitute for those facts. |
| 8. nzbd-authoritative persistence | **Fail** | The contract test proves that `Session::new_with_opts` auto-restores the library record before returning. The persistence module and store injection point are private in 8.1.1, so nzbd cannot filter first. A tested upstream patch now supplies the missing opt-out, but this gate remains failed until an accepted stable release contains it. |
| 9. Resource, package, and license delta | **Partial** | Measurements are recorded in §4. A blocking cargo-deny 0.20.2 policy passes locally across all features and the locked graph, and its [first Actions run passed](https://github.com/pjunod/nzbd/actions/runs/31064446916) on 2026-08-06 UTC. The repository-wide Supply chain check also freezes the reviewed advisory package/feature sets and sole MPL-2.0 package path without pinning nzbd's own version. Stable 8.1.1 hard-codes 128 live peers per torrent, exposes no session-wide cap, retains an unbounded known-peer set, and leaves the pre-routing incoming-handshake set unbounded; its HTTP tracker path also has no request deadline, buffers the whole response, and accepts a zero announce interval. Established peers can additionally pipeline piece and metadata requests into unbounded scheduler/writer queues. DHT datagrams, recursive nodes, maintenance work, delivered peers, and metadata queues have separate unbounded retained-work paths; current main adds an unbounded LSD result stream. Tested contribution candidates now prove each runtime boundary, but they are not shipped capability. The adapter's input caps cannot close those gaps. The [gate 9 review brief](BITTORRENT_GATE9_REVIEW.md) isolates the remaining human acceptance and resource-control decisions. |
| 10. One explicit rustls provider | **Pass** | The process starts without a provider, explicitly installs aws-lc, and constructs librqbit’s rustls client without the mixed-provider panic. |
| 11. v1-only boundary | **Pass** | Stable input uses v1 pieces/`btih`; v2-only and hybrid `.torrent` files and magnets return separate named errors before managed-torrent admission. Magnet classification reads decoded `xt` query parameters rather than searching the whole URI, so version-looking text in a display name or tracker URL cannot create a false v2/hybrid result. The adapter accepts one valid 40-hex or 32-base32 `btih`, rejects missing, malformed, or duplicate v1 topics by name, and rechecks the resolved info dictionary before storage exists. |

Gates 7 and 8 are stop conditions in §4.3 of the proposal. This is an M0
**no-go**, even though the data-path tests are healthy.

## 2. What was built

### 2.1 Isolated engine adapter

`crates/nzbd-torrent` pins stable 8.1.1 and contains the only librqbit-facing
code. The daemon does not depend on it. The boundary currently provides:

- explicit process-wide aws-lc provider installation;
- session construction with DHT off by default, UPnP unavailable, DHT
  persistence disabled unconditionally, no library fast-resume/session
  persistence, global trackers, remote blocklist, or deferred-write buffer,
  and proxy+DHT rejected because DHT bypasses the engine's SOCKS path. Every
  stable 8.1.1 session option is assigned explicitly so a new upstream option
  becomes a compile-time review event instead of silently inheriting a default;
- per-torrent admission options assigned explicitly for metadata resolution
  and managed torrents, with selective files, alternate output roots, custom
  trackers/storage, and deferred writes unavailable. Newly added upstream add
  options likewise require an explicit adapter review;
- raw v1 metainfo and two-stage v1 magnet admission, with an engine-compatible
  exact-topic grammar, eager `so=` expansion rejected before rqbit parsing,
  and resolved metadata returned by list-only mode and revalidated before
  storage construction;
- bounded bootstrap peers: caller order is retained, duplicates are removed,
  non-unicast/port-zero/IPv6 endpoints fail by name, and resolved magnet peers
  cannot grow the handoff beyond 80. This bounds admission input only; it does
  not cap peers later discovered from trackers, PEX, or DHT;
- one concurrent torrent initialization: stable rqbit's unset default permits
  three payload integrity scans at once, while the dormant session explicitly
  serializes that disk-heavy work. This is an initialization-I/O guard, not the
  future shared active-download scheduler or a runtime peer cap;
- one DHT-disabled session pressure probe that admits 100 distinct one-byte
  torrents within 30 seconds, keeps an exact 10-active/90-paused mix, and
  requires session shutdown within 10 seconds. The torrents have no trackers
  or initial peers, so the test exercises adapter and engine bookkeeping
  without public discovery or payload transfer. A passing wall-clock deadline
  is a regression guard, not a memory or throughput measurement. The
  [first native evidence run](https://github.com/pjunod/nzbd/actions/runs/31330178035)
  passed the isolated adapter suite on 2026-08-09 UTC for Linux x86_64 GNU,
  Linux x86_64 musl, Linux aarch64 musl, macOS aarch64, and Windows x86_64;
- one optimized-process memory probe repeats that exact trackerless, peerless
  100-torrent mix and samples resident memory before session construction,
  after construction, after every ten admissions, and after all handles have
  completed initialization into the exact 10-live/90-paused state. It fails
  above a preliminary 32 MiB growth ceiling on each native runner. The probe
  first proves exact-ceiling acceptance and first-byte-excess rejection
  through the same guard used for the measurement. This is a sampled retained-
  memory regression guard, not an allocator peak, active-swarm, or exhaustion-
  resistance claim;
- a second optimized-process probe constructs and validates the accepted
  100,000-file inventory while sampling resident memory before fixture
  construction, after construction, and after validation. It fails above a
  preliminary 64 MiB growth ceiling on each native runner. The same guard's
  exact-ceiling and first-byte-excess negative control runs before the
  measurement. This is retained memory evidence, not the parser's transient
  allocation peak or a concurrent hostile-submission test;
- an ignored, crate-private local-swarm unit probe injects
  `ErrorKind::StorageFull` from `pwrite_all` after one successful 16 KiB piece
  write. The affected 256 KiB torrent must become `Error`, remain incomplete,
  retain a display-safe fault fact, and answer an independently scheduled
  stats request within one second. Before the fault is admitted, a separate
  64 MiB torrent must already be live with nonzero incomplete progress through
  normal filesystem storage; it must remain live at the fault boundary and
  then complete in the same engine session. The fault state and exact write
  accounting must remain unchanged afterward, and both sessions must stop
  within ten seconds. The custom-storage helper is compiled only into crate
  unit tests and is absent from every non-test build; normal admission still
  forces `storage_factory: None`. This proves containment of an injected
  write-time fault and a future interception point, not general ENOSPC
  behavior. In particular it does not exercise initialization-time
  `ensure_file_length` failure, and that stable-engine path remains explicit
  M2 work. There is no daemon disk-guard latch, API responsiveness proof,
  new-request pause, or continued-upload proof, and stable rqbit currently
  reports the affected torrent as an error rather than a paused download;
- explicit peer lifetimes: the dormant session pins stable 8.1.1's effective
  10-second connect and read/write timeouts and 120-second keepalive interval;
  per-add options inherit this reviewed session policy instead of introducing
  another override;
- bytes-only managed admission: the private engine handoff accepts only
  metainfo bytes that already passed nzbd preflight. Stable rqbit's URL variant
  cannot bypass nzbd's source-fetch size, redirect, timeout, or redaction
  policy through this helper. A separate dormant HTTP(S) helper follows at
  most five manually validated redirects, strips authentication across origin
  changes, ignores ambient proxy variables, retains no cookies, uses the
  process-wide aws-lc provider with OS trust roots, bounds declared and
  streamed bodies, applies one end-to-end timeout, and returns only
  preflighted bytes. Its private-CA loopback and oversized chunked-body tests
  pin the TLS and while-streaming properties directly;
- named v2-only and hybrid rejection for both metainfo and magnets;
- fail-closed HTTP/HTTPS/UDP tracker URL validation for metainfo and magnets,
  with at most 64 unique non-empty trackers and 2 KiB per decoded URL, plus
  exact-one-tracker validation for private metainfo;
- pause, resume, idempotent forget, and bounded delete-data delegation;
- live session upload/download rate changes;
- info hash, phase, progress, upload, per-file progress, rates, derived ETA,
  peer aggregates, completion, display-safe error facts, and an importer-safe
  content-file inventory that omits BEP 47 padding entries;
- a 2 KiB display-safe boundary for rqbit operation/stat errors that removes
  magnet URIs, URL credentials/queries, inline, colon-delimited, JSON-style,
  and whitespace-separated secret assignments, peer addresses, absolute
  paths, and control characters before returning adapter values;
- split SOCKS URL/username/password input with password redaction, a strict
  credential form, named rejection of UDP trackers, and a recording relay
  proving the peer path did not also connect directly; and
- an idle release harness used only for M0 measurements.

The crate forbids unsafe code. It is intentionally not a complete production
backend: there is no queue owner channel, durable torrent record, config/API,
URL-fetch route, watch folder, seed policy, or session lifecycle in the daemon.
The source-fetch helper is not reachable from production daemon input.

The dependency graph also required a production-daemon TLS correction outside
the isolated crate: `crates/nzbd/src/main.rs` and `crates/nzbd/src/tls.rs`
install the process-wide aws-lc provider before any daemon rustls client or
server is constructed. That idempotent provider selection is the only runtime
daemon behavior changed by the spike.

### 2.2 Deterministic tests

The isolated suite covers:

- `.torrent` and magnet download from one local TCP seeder;
- a fake BEP 9 metadata peer proving unsafe magnet-resolved paths fail while
  the destination directory remains empty;
- exact-byte verification and upload accounting;
- a live 16 KiB/s limit followed by an unlimited transfer;
- pause and resume before download completion;
- keep-data and delete-data behavior, including idempotence;
- named rejection of zero, empty, and multi-port TCP listen ranges so the
  adapter cannot silently request an ephemeral port or probe a range;
- deterministic deduplication and an 80-peer bound for explicit bootstrap
  peers, with rejection of port-zero, non-unicast, and IPv6 endpoints before
  the IPv4-only v1 engine path sees them;
- authenticated SOCKS5 peer routing through a loopback proxy, with a
  recording relay proving no parallel direct connection;
- origin-only SOCKS proxy validation, including rejection of paths, queries,
  and fragments before rqbit's peer and tracker clients can interpret the
  same setting differently;
- named rejection of proxy+DHT and proxy+UDP-tracker leak paths;
- named rejection of tracker port zero rather than deferring an invalid
  endpoint to rqbit's retry/error path;
- named rejection of privacy-unknown magnets and known-private metainfo in a
  DHT-enabled session before rqbit can contact even an explicitly supplied
  peer;
- password redaction and invalid proxy combinations, including embedded proxy
  credentials before validation, multi-token authorization/cookie values,
  embedded JSON/query assignments, private-tracker credential names, and
  alternate assignment separators;
- engine/stat error redaction and UTF-8-safe 2 KiB truncation with an explicit
  marker;
- authenticated HTTP source handling that preserves credentials only across
  same-origin redirects, strips them across origin changes, does not replay
  response cookies, exposes only origins in errors, rejects non-HTTP targets,
  accepts exactly five redirects and rejects the sixth, bounds both declared
  and chunked bodies, enforces one end-to-end timeout, and preflights the
  returned metainfo before it leaves the helper;
- one-tracker private-torrent discovery and multi-tracker rejection;
- a positive-control PEX peer that public torrents contact and private torrents
  ignore; the canary address is available only through the peer-wire message;
- traversal rejection before filesystem escape;
- canonical-root and existing-symlink preflight whose external target remains
  untouched, with the remaining check/write race called out explicitly;
- adapter-owned portable path preflight for single- and multi-file torrents,
  including safe named errors, Windows device/character/alias rejection,
  metainfo-declared symlink rejection, and exact or portable full-case-fold
  duplicate path rejection;
- parsed BEP 47 padding metainfo whose padding entry stays out of the
  importer-safe content inventory without shifting later file progress;
- centralized proposal limits for raw metainfo, magnet length, file count, one
  path component, one projected relative path, and aggregate projected path
  bytes, with exact boundary and first-excess tests;
- one session retaining 100 distinct torrents at once, split into ten
  live-but-peerless and ninety paused handles, with bounded admission and
  shutdown deadlines and no tracker, DHT, initial-peer, or payload traffic;
- deterministic, socket-free preflight mutations covering every truncation and
  bounded single-byte replacement, deletion, and insertion around valid v1,
  v2-only, and hybrid seeds, with exact accepted/rejected outcome counts plus
  nesting, length-overflow, duplicate-info, trailing-byte, and framed-marker
  invariants;
- checked v1 payload/piece/hash geometry, including zero values, aggregate
  length overflow, malformed hash width, mismatched hash count, and valid
  zero-length sidecars;
- the explicit aws-lc provider invariant;
- v2-only and hybrid named rejection for metainfo and magnets;
- query-aware magnet validation for hex/base32 `btih` with lowercase base32
  normalized to rqbit's accepted spelling, valid `btmh`,
  duplicate/missing/unknown exact topics, engine-incompatible casing, false
  version markers outside `xt`, and pre-engine rejection of unbounded `so=`
  file-range expansion; and
- the persistence auto-restore behavior that fails gate 8.

The
[review-correction native run](https://github.com/pjunod/nzbd/actions/runs/31264422471)
passed on 2026-08-08 UTC and recorded these hosted temporary-volume results:

| Runner | ASCII case | NFC/NFD | Ligature/ASCII | Sharp-s/SS | Width pair |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Linux | Distinct | Distinct | Distinct | Distinct | Distinct |
| macOS | Aliased | Aliased | Aliased | Aliased | Distinct |
| Windows | Aliased | Distinct | Distinct | Distinct | Distinct |

The collision classes from ASCII case through sharp-s/SS are adapter-rejected.
The width pair is still admitted, so every native job requires it to remain
distinct. These values describe the hosted runner temp volumes, not operator
payload roots.

All peers, trackers, proxies, and DHT responders in the suite are local and
generated by the tests. The ordinary suite requires permission to bind
loopback ports but does not need the internet. The Linux-only capture harness
resolves rqbit's two bootstrap names, redirects their IPv4 UDP traffic to its
local DHT probe, and blocks matching IPv6 bootstrap traffic before the capture
point. Separate public lookups prove the probe is live before and throughout a
15-second private canary window. The harness scans every captured UDP packet,
not only redirected DHT traffic, for the private binary hash and the ASCII hash
used by LSD.

The bounded mutation corpus is a fast ordinary-test regression layer, not a
claim of coverage-guided fuzzing completeness. Two separate, feature-gated
`cargo-fuzz` targets exercise the adapter-owned complete metadata-only file
admission wrapper and exact magnet preflight without creating a session or
touching the network or filesystem. The metainfo target runs across all
proxy/DHT combinations. Its nine reviewed seeds cover valid v1, private v1,
v2-only, hybrid, UDP tracker, announce-list, multifile,
private-multiple-tracker, and unsafe-path outcomes. The magnet target runs
every valid UTF-8 input in normal and proxy modes from reviewed valid-v1,
lowercase-base32, v2-only, hybrid, eager-selection, and proxy+UDP-tracker
seeds. Every reviewed seed has a deterministic named-outcome contract and
lives separately from its target's ignored evolving corpus. The targets use
bencode and URI dictionaries and cap generated input at 1 MiB and 32 KiB,
respectively; the latter permits campaigns to cross the exact 16 KiB magnet
limit. Each target runs 20,000 cases on relevant pull requests and a separate
five-minute weekly campaign. The main workspace suite passes a valid magnet at
exactly 16 KiB and a valid v1 document at exactly the 10 MiB default metainfo
ceiling, then requires the first excess byte to fail by the respective named
size boundary. It also accepts a valid 100,000-file v1 inventory below the
metainfo ceiling and requires file 100,001 to fail by the named file-count
boundary. CI does not persist either evolved corpus, prove a peak-memory
ceiling or path writes, or complete M5's symlink, mounted-filesystem,
sustained-campaign, and broader resource-exhaustion work.

The two-stage magnet guard closes the storage-ordering gap, not the allocation
gap inside stable rqbit: its metadata reader may allocate up to 32 MiB before
returning list-only bytes, after which nzbd applies the 10 MiB contract. A
production magnet path still needs a reviewed pre-allocation answer; gates 7
and 8 already keep that path disabled.

Stable 8.1.1 also creates a private 128-permit live-peer semaphore for every
torrent. Its public session/add options cannot apply the proposal's default of
80 live peers per torrent, and there is no shared session semaphore for the
proposed 400-peer total. The adapter's 80-peer guard bounds only the explicit
and resolved bootstrap vector handed to rqbit; tracker, PEX, and DHT discovery
can still fill the engine's 128 live slots. The pinned rqbit-main snapshot
`4e5f94cbcf1d57ec500885c77cf1e24d70232d89` exposes a per-torrent
`peer_limit`, but still no session-total limit. Production integration must use
an accepted stable per-torrent API and shared-session budget before advertising
the 80/400 configuration contract. The contribution kit now carries matching
stable and main candidates: every outgoing or routed incoming peer holds one
per-torrent permit and, when configured, one session-shared permit until its
manager exits. Exact-boundary tests prove two torrents share one aggregate
ceiling. That patch is review evidence, not a stable engine capability, so it
does not change gate 9 or authorize production networking.

Neither stable 8.1.1 nor the pinned main snapshot bounds retained peer records.
Every unique tracker, DHT, PEX, explicit, or incoming address enters a map and
unbounded peer-adder channel before a live permit is acquired; queued,
backoff, dead, and not-needed records do not count against the 80/400 manager
limits. The contribution kit now carries stable and main candidates with
caller-selected per-torrent and shared-session record permits. The permits
live inside each map record, failed shared acquisition returns the local slot,
incoming-only records are removed when their manager exits, and
alternate-address reconnects carry the retained record handle and transition
to queued before enqueue. Exact-limit and one-entry retry tests pass on both
source lines. On exact stable 8.1.1, `Peer` measured 296
bytes on macOS arm64; 4,096 raw structs are 1,212,416 bytes (1.16 MiB) before
map, allocator, and live-bitfield overhead. The proposed 1,024/4,096 limits
remain preliminary reviewer policy, and the patch remains unreleased evidence.

Stable 8.1.1's TCP listener accepts every socket into an unbounded set of
pending handshake checks before it can route a connection to a torrent or
acquire either live-peer permit. Each incomplete check can retain its socket,
buffers, and task for the 10-second read timeout, so a fixed timeout does not
bound concurrent pre-routing work. Current rqbit main now exposes a
per-listener `max_pending_incoming_handshake_checks` option with a default of
256. The contribution kit carries an exact stable-only 256-check backport and
tests its 255/256 boundary; its verifier checks main's native equivalent
without applying a redundant patch. The preliminary value and TCP-only scope
still need human acceptance and an accepted stable release. This evidence does
not change gate 9 or authorize a production listener.

Stable 8.1.1 and the pinned rqbit-main snapshot also share three tracker-side
resource gaps. HTTP announces have no tracker-owned deadline, call
`Response::bytes()` without a body limit, and accept a tracker-provided zero
announce interval; UDP is clamped only to five seconds. The adapter now limits
one source to 64 tracker URLs, but input fan-out is not a per-request memory,
lifetime, or request-rate budget. The contribution kit carries tested stable
and main candidates that stream at most 1 MiB within 30 seconds and clamp
unforced HTTP/UDP intervals to at least 60 seconds. Those patches are review
evidence, not a stable engine capability, so gate 9 remains Partial and
production wiring remains disabled.

The asynchronous-queue audit found a separate post-handshake boundary. A live
peer can pipeline valid piece requests into an unbounded torrent upload
scheduler and then an unbounded per-peer writer while upload rate limits or a
slow socket delay draining. Valid BEP 9 metadata requests bypass the scheduler
and enter that same writer directly. A socket timeout bounds one write's
lifetime, not the number of queued response records. The contribution kit now
carries stable and main candidates with one 128-permit response window per
peer and advertises that window as BEP 10 `reqq`. Admission is non-blocking: a
peer that exceeds the advertised outstanding-response window is disconnected,
so its socket reader never waits behind torrent-global upload throttling. Each
permit follows a piece response through scheduler and writer or a metadata
response through the writer and is released only after the socket write
completes or is cancelled. Production-path admission and blocked-write tests
fail when those guards are intentionally bypassed. The preliminary 128 policy
and over-window disconnect behavior require human acceptance, and the patch
remains unreleased evidence, so gate 9 stays Partial.

The same audit followed discovery work back before live-peer admission. Both
source lines use unbounded channels for outgoing DHT datagrams, recursive
nodes, and delivered peers; recursive futures can also grow without a fixed
active-work limit. Bucket refreshes and questionable-node pings add unbounded
maintenance channels/future sets, while bootstrap starts every configured
hostname concurrently. That finite configuration fan-out is intentionally
unchanged because an eight-host concurrency window can let one hostname's
24-hour retry budget starve later entries. The magnet metadata resolver's
semaphore limits active I/O but not queued futures or its retained
unique-address set. Current main adds an unbounded LSD result stream and leaves
its periodic announcer alive
after the stream is dropped. The contribution kit now carries stable and main
candidates with 256-record DHT send, recursive-node, and delivered-peer queues;
32 active recursive requests per worker; 256 queued and 32 active DHT
maintenance requests per worker; 128 active metadata attempts; 256 pending
metadata candidates; and a 4,096-entry deduplication set that does not
terminate discovery. The main candidate also bounds LSD results at 256, ties
the announce task to the stream
lifecycle, protects replacement registrations, and keeps protocol replies
independent of local result saturation. Both candidates process recursive
nodes before best-effort peer delivery, use the
normal requery delay when the node queue is saturated, and reuse one DHT
response per recursive step instead of issuing the same request twice.
Exact-boundary proofs pass and deliberate DHT/LSD guard
regressions fail. These values and overload policies remain unreleased evidence,
so gate 9 stays Partial and production discovery remains disabled.

### 2.3 Queue schema version fallback

The independent M1a groundwork adds a versioned queue envelope:

- missing `schema_version` reads as legacy version 1;
- new writes use version 2;
- a future version fails by name. Healthy current snapshots parse once; if a
  typed parse fails, a header-only fallback distinguishes a future version
  from ordinary corruption so a future enum cannot masquerade as a generic
  parse failure;
- versions older than the supported floor fail by name; and
- the writer refuses to emit a non-current schema.

This is useful even while the engine decision is blocked. No torrent enum
variant or scheduler path was added.

### 2.4 Executable platform and dependency gate

`.github/workflows/bittorrent-m0.yml` turns gate 1 from a workstation claim
into a repeatable native matrix. Under Rust 1.85 it runs the real isolated
adapter suite — local seeder, tracker, authenticated SOCKS relay, persistence
contract, provider check, and input validation — on:

- Linux x86-64 glibc;
- macOS arm64;
- Windows x86-64 MSVC;
- Linux x86-64 musl; and
- Linux arm64 musl.

The two musl jobs run on their native CPU architectures and link and execute
the tests; they are not `cargo check` substitutes. The workflow is path-gated
to the adapter, lockfile, workspace dependency declaration, daemon TLS
provider initialization, its own workflow, and the policy script, so unrelated
documentation changes do not burn five native builders.

The first matrix run did its job before this report claimed success: Windows
failed while compiling Tokio 1.53.0 because that target's signal path calls
`OnceLock::wait`, which is unstable on Rust 1.85. The Linux-only workspace MSRV
check could not see the target-specific code. The workspace therefore pins
Tokio 1.52.4: upstream declares Rust 1.71 and its Windows signal path uses
`OnceLock::get_or_init` instead. The
[corrected native run](https://github.com/pjunod/nzbd/actions/runs/31060326800)
completed successfully on 2026-08-06 UTC. All five platform jobs executed the
isolated adapter suite under Rust 1.85, including the corrected Windows path,
and the dependency-policy job passed.

Before those builders run, `scripts/check-bittorrent-deps.sh` checks the normal
and feature graphs under the MSRV toolchain. It requires exactly
`librqbit 8.1.1`, requires `rust-tls`, rejects librqbit's default feature set,
and rejects `openssl`, `openssl-sys`, or `native-tls` anywhere in the adapter's
normal dependency closure. This guards the accepted dependency shape; it does
not replace binary linkage inspection or the gate 9 license/vulnerability
review.

Adding the gate starts no session in the daemon and changes no config, API,
listener, admission, or recovery behavior. The successful corrected run makes
gate 1 a pass. Gates 4, 7, and 8 remain blocked regardless of the platform
result.

## 3. The two blocking engine gaps

### 3.1 Fast resume cannot remain subordinate to nzbd state

The proposal requires this startup order:

1. load and validate nzbd’s queue snapshot;
2. determine the authoritative durable torrent jobs;
3. create the library session without starting anything else; and
4. explicitly restore only those jobs, using library resume data as an
   accelerator.

Stable 8.1.1 does something different whenever `SessionOptions.persistence`
is set: `Session::new_with_opts` opens the store, streams every stored record,
adds them all, and only then returns the session. `fastresume` shares that
persistence path. The public option selects JSON or Postgres storage, but it
does not provide an `auto_restore = false` switch, an authoritative ID filter,
or a public custom-store constructor. The `session_persistence` module itself
is private.

The contract test creates one persisted paused torrent, stops the session, and
constructs a second session without re-adding any nzbd job. The second session
already contains the torrent. That is a second queue authority, not merely a
cache.

Rejected workarounds:

- parsing or rewriting librqbit’s private `session.json` schema before boot;
- deleting resume records opportunistically and hoping crash order agrees;
- auto-restoring first, then stopping “ghost” torrents after they may already
  have announced or opened payload files; and
- copying the private persistence module into nzbd.

The acceptable engine API is small: either separate resume storage from
automatic admission, add an authoritative restore predicate/list, or accept a
public persistence store whose enumeration nzbd controls before session start.

### 3.2 Discovery health is not a public fact

`ManagedTorrent::stats()` is useful and the adapter now projects its stable
transfer/peer facts. Tracker monitors, however, keep their last errors inside
private tasks and tracing output. The public torrent stats model does not
answer:

- which tracker is working, backing off, or rejected;
- the last redacted tracker failure;
- whether DHT is healthy, disabled, or degraded for this job; or
- whether a trackerless magnet is stalled on discovery rather than peers.

Inferring these states from a zero peer count would make the API lie: a healthy
tracker can return no peers, and a failed tracker can coexist with live peers.
The accepted observability contract therefore needs a public discovery-health
snapshot or events with stable meanings.

### 3.3 The authoritative-restore patch is ready, not released

[`contrib/rqbit/0001-allow-persistence-without-auto-restore.patch`](../contrib/rqbit/0001-allow-persistence-without-auto-restore.patch)
targets rqbit v8.1.1 commit `00b97485160ff5b5aa2b379ea0815d568ec665f0`.
It adds one backwards-compatible `SessionOptions::disable_auto_restore` flag.
The default remains false, so existing rqbit callers still restore every
record. Setting it true keeps JSON persistence and fast resume active while
skipping only the constructor's implicit admission loop.

Both the exact v8.1.1 backport and the contribution patch for rqbit main at
`4e5f94cbcf1d57ec500885c77cf1e24d70232d89` carry the same contract. The test
persists two paused torrents with deterministic four-piece payloads after the
authoritative torrent validates exactly one 16 KiB piece. It then replaces that
file with the complete valid 64 KiB payload before restart, constructs a
session that starts empty, and explicitly restores only the authoritative
torrent with its persisted `preferred_id`. The restored torrent still reports
only the persisted 16 KiB and remains incomplete; a full disk recheck would
report 64 KiB and complete. Finally, a legacy session still restores both
records. That verifies the ownership and non-empty fast-resume seams without
exposing the private persistence schema or deleting library state before
startup.

[`scripts/check-rqbit-authoritative-restore-patch.sh`](../scripts/check-rqbit-authoritative-restore-patch.sh)
clones a supplied clean v8.1.1 or rqbit-main tree locally, requires the exact
stable tag or a descendant of the documented main base, reports the verified
SHA, applies the matching patch directly or by three-way fallback on main,
verifies formatting, and runs the isolated Rust-TLS test. The dedicated
`rqbit contribution patches` workflow checks both variants on relevant changes
and weekly for upstream-main drift. Both variants passed locally on 2026-08-06. This is
contribution evidence, not a production dependency: nzbd still pins
unmodified stable 8.1.1, gate 8 remains failed, and no daemon session consumes
the new option.

### 3.4 The discovery-health patch is ready, not released

[`contrib/rqbit/0003-expose-per-torrent-discovery-health.patch`](../contrib/rqbit/0003-expose-per-torrent-discovery-health.patch)
targets the exact v8.1.1 commit. Its public `ManagedTorrent::discovery_health`
snapshot distinguishes disabled, private-suppressed, inactive, searching,
working, and degraded DHT states, with current-run request and peer counters.
Each tracker reports a stable state, next-announcement delay, and bounded last
failure category. Public endpoints retain only scheme, host, and port; path,
query, user information, response body, and credentials never enter the
snapshot.

The corresponding rqbit-main patch starts at the same documented main base as
the authoritative-restore contribution. Tests prove endpoint and serialized
snapshot redaction, private-torrent DHT suppression, DHT success/failure
transitions, HTTP failure classification, tracker backoff, and rejected
tracker retention. The focused stable suites pass 37 tests with three
pre-existing network tests ignored; the focused main suites pass 69 tests
with six upstream integration tests ignored.

[`scripts/check-rqbit-discovery-health-patch.sh`](../scripts/check-rqbit-discovery-health-patch.sh)
uses the same exact-stable and descendant-of-main rules as the restore
verifier, reports the tested SHA, allows a three-way fallback only for main,
checks formatting, and runs all three affected crate suites. The dedicated
workflow tests all contribution candidates against stable and main on
relevant changes and weekly for upstream drift. This is contribution evidence
only: nzbd still pins unmodified stable 8.1.1, gate 7 remains failed, and
production wiring remains prohibited.

### 3.5 The peer-metadata allocation ceiling is ready, not released

Stable rqbit rejects BEP 9 metadata above 32 MiB, but the ceiling is hardcoded
inside its peer metadata reader. An embedding application can reject resolved
metainfo afterward, but that is too late to enforce nzbd's proposed 10 MiB
hostile-input allocation limit for magnets.

[`contrib/rqbit/0016-limit-peer-metadata-before-allocation.patch`](../contrib/rqbit/0016-limit-peer-metadata-before-allocation.patch)
targets the exact v8.1.1 commit, and `0006` carries the same change for the
documented rqbit-main base. They add an optional
`PeerConnectionOptions::max_metadata_size`, merge it through the existing
session/per-add peer-option path, retain 32 MiB when it is unset, and reject
an oversized extended handshake before allocating a buffer or sending
metadata requests. The focused test accepts the exact configured boundary and
rejects one byte above it.

[`scripts/check-rqbit-metadata-size-limit-patch.sh`](../scripts/check-rqbit-metadata-size-limit-patch.sh)
applies the matching patch to a clean stable or main tree, checks formatting,
and runs that test. The contribution workflow exercises both variants on
relevant changes and weekly for upstream drift. This is a tested contribution
artifact awaiting human review, not a production dependency: nzbd still pins
unmodified 8.1.1 and must not admit magnets until an accepted stable release
exposes an equivalent pre-allocation limit.

## 4. Measurements and dependency review

Measurements are from one run of the isolated optimized `m0_idle` harness on
macOS 26.6 arm64. They are not the final daemon delta because the daemon
intentionally does not link the blocked adapter.

| Measurement | Result |
|---|---:|
| Unstripped optimized harness | 10,111,360 bytes (9.64 MiB) |
| Maximum resident set while starting/stopping one idle session | 8,814,592 bytes (8.41 MiB) |
| Normal dependency closure of `nzbd-torrent` | 222 unique package/version identities |
| New package/version identities in the workspace lockfile | 178 |
| OpenSSL dynamic link | none; only CoreFoundation, libiconv, and libSystem were listed on this host |

The
[review-correction cross-platform sampled-memory run](https://github.com/pjunod/nzbd/actions/runs/31344145707)
passed both optimized probes on 2026-08-10 UTC after the probes began awaiting
every session handle's initialized phase, added discriminating ceiling
controls, and narrowed the preliminary ceilings. Values are process resident
set samples in bytes; the time column is admission plus shutdown for the
session probe and validation for the metainfo probe.

| Platform | Probe | Baseline RSS | Maximum sampled RSS | Sampled growth | Time |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Linux aarch64 musl | 100-torrent session | 1,789,952 | 6,717,440 | 4,927,488 | 51 ms + 1,002 ms |
| Linux aarch64 musl | 100,000-file preflight | 745,472 | 4,591,616 | 3,846,144 | 85 ms |
| Linux x86_64 GNU | 100-torrent session | 4,845,568 | 11,001,856 | 6,156,288 | 40 ms + 1,001 ms |
| Linux x86_64 GNU | 100,000-file preflight | 2,793,472 | 18,137,088 | 15,343,616 | 63 ms |
| Linux x86_64 musl | 100-torrent session | 4,919,296 | 9,838,592 | 4,919,296 | 94 ms + 1,001 ms |
| Linux x86_64 musl | 100,000-file preflight | 831,488 | 4,812,800 | 3,981,312 | 116 ms |
| macOS aarch64 | 100-torrent session | 6,946,816 | 11,010,048 | 4,063,232 | 32 ms + 1,003 ms |
| macOS aarch64 | 100,000-file preflight | 5,980,160 | 33,325,056 | 27,344,896 | 62 ms |
| Windows x86_64 MSVC | 100-torrent session | 8,306,688 | 11,243,520 | 2,936,832 | 2,713 ms + 1,007 ms |
| Windows x86_64 MSVC | 100,000-file preflight | 4,694,016 | 8,458,240 | 3,764,224 | 137 ms |

All session growth results stayed below 6 MiB and all metainfo growth
results stayed below 27 MiB, below the preliminary 32 MiB and 64 MiB
regression ceilings. Those ceilings retain headroom for hosted-runner noise
without permitting the previous order-of-magnitude regressions. The wide
platform spread is why these remain
platform-specific sampled-growth guards, not portable peak-memory promises.

The
[review-correction storage-fault run](https://github.com/pjunod/nzbd/actions/runs/31344311581)
passed the ignored crate-private probe on all five native targets on
2026-08-10 UTC. Every target injected `StorageFull` on the second write after
one 16,384-byte write returned successfully from the filesystem, kept the
faulted 262,144-byte torrent incomplete in `Error` with zero engine progress,
and preserved exactly two write attempts and one successful write after the
already-live 67,108,864-byte control torrent completed. The response deadline
measures the independently scheduled stats reply rather than synchronous lock
acquisition on the test task.

| Platform | Fault transition | Stats response | Control progress at fault | Control completion |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Linux aarch64 musl | 51 ms | 0 ms | 29,769,728 bytes | 175 ms |
| Linux x86_64 GNU | 52 ms | 0 ms | 26,918,912 bytes | 186 ms |
| Linux x86_64 musl | 25 ms | 0 ms | 11,272,192 bytes | 201 ms |
| macOS aarch64 | 25 ms | 0 ms | 23,003,136 bytes | 98 ms |
| Windows x86_64 MSVC | 31 ms | 0 ms | 16,384 bytes | 513 ms |

This evidence remains deliberately narrow: it proves the injected write-time
path and an already-active sibling's containment, not durable persistence of
the accepted chunk or initialization-time `ensure_file_length` behavior.

The 2026-08-07 review remediation refreshed these measurements after adding
`icu_casemap 2.1.1` and `icu_casemap_data 2.1.1` for Unicode simple case
folding. The change added two package identities, 36,400 binary bytes, and
16,384 bytes to the one-sample idle RSS measurement.

The normal closure reports permissive licenses: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC,
Unicode-3.0, Zlib, Unlicense, CDLA-Permissive-2.0, and related compatible
expressions. `option-ext 0.2.0` is MPL-2.0. No GPL, AGPL, LGPL, SSPL, or BUSL
identifier appeared in the normal closure. This is an inventory, not legal
advice or final acceptance.

The initial resolver selected 2026 transitive releases requiring Rust 1.86 or
1.88. The lockfile now pins compatible releases in the allowed semver ranges,
including `serde_with 3.14.1`, `idna_adapter 1.2.1`, and ICU4X 2.1.x. With the
existing `time 0.3.41` MSRV pin restored, the actual Rust 1.85.1 toolchain
passes `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` on macOS.

The checked-in [`deny.toml`](../deny.toml) policy passes locally with
cargo-deny 0.20.2 across all features and the locked graph. It fails on an
unapproved license, registry, Git source, wildcard dependency, OpenSSL/native
TLS dependency, vulnerable or yanked crate, or unmaintained direct workspace
dependency. `option-ext 0.2.0` is the only license exception; its MPL-2.0
file-level copyleft is accepted at that exact version.

The first advisory run found and removed the daemon's direct
`rustls-pemfile 2.2.0` dependency. The daemon now parses certificates and
private keys through the maintained `rustls-pki-types` API already re-exported
by rustls. Three exact advisory exceptions remain:

- [`RUSTSEC-2026-0194`](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0194)
  and
  [`RUSTSEC-2026-0195`](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0195)
  affect quick-xml 0.37 through librqbit 8.1.1's unconditional UPnP helper.
  The path is reachable only when UPnP port forwarding is enabled. The adapter
  no longer exposes an UPnP input and unconditionally constructs rqbit with
  port forwarding false. A production gate must remove both exceptions or
  keep UPnP unavailable.
- [`RUSTSEC-2026-0009`](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0009)
  affects `time`'s RFC 2822 parser. The daemon's TLS tests and the torrent
  adapter's private-CA test reach it through rcgen, which compiles `time`
  without its parsing feature, so the vulnerable parser is absent. The fixed
  `time 0.3.47` raises its MSRV to Rust 1.88, while nzbd's verified floor is
  Rust 1.85.

[`supply-chain.yml`](../.github/workflows/supply-chain.yml) pins
`cargo-deny-action` to an immutable revision and runs separate blocking policy
and RustSec jobs on every pull request, main or release-tag push, a daily
schedule, and manual dispatch. The
[first blocking run](https://github.com/pjunod/nzbd/actions/runs/31064446916)
passed both jobs on 2026-08-06 UTC. Gate 9 remains **Partial** until a reviewer
accepts both the recorded delta and the narrow advisory dispositions. A green
exception is not evidence that the underlying code became safe to enable.

[`scripts/check-reviewed-dependency-exceptions.sh`](../scripts/check-reviewed-dependency-exceptions.sh)
now makes the disposition executable in the repository-wide Supply chain
workflow. It requires the reviewed quick-xml package set, the exact `time`
package and `alloc`/`std` feature sets, the MPL-2.0 `option-ext` path, and only
the three named RustSec ignores. Workspace-member versions are normalized, and
an obsolete package pin fails with the exception that must be reconsidered.
The adapter unit test independently proves that its constructed rqbit options
cannot enable UPnP. The [gate 9 review brief](BITTORRENT_GATE9_REVIEW.md)
collects the measurements, exceptions, renewal rules, and exact decision the
reviewer must accept or reject; this report does not pre-accept it.

---

## 5. Recommended next decision

Preferred path:

1. open an upstream design issue for the discovery-health contract before
   submitting its multi-crate implementation, so rqbit maintainers can shape
   the public surface before nzbd treats the patch as an integration plan;
2. review and submit the prepared authoritative-restore patch and the agreed
   discovery-health implementation upstream;
3. review and submit the independent peer-metadata allocation ceiling;
4. review the independent runtime resource candidates, including the
   established-peer response backlog and discovery-pressure chain, and submit
   only the boundaries a human can explain and maintain;
5. reconcile all changes with upstream feedback without weakening nzbd's
   ownership, privacy, or observability contracts;
6. pin the first stable release containing the accepted contracts;
7. rerun all eleven M0 gates on native macOS, Linux glibc/musl, and Windows;
8. run the packet-capture private-mode test and obtain reviewer acceptance of
   the resource, package, license, and advisory dispositions isolated in the
   [gate 9 review brief](BITTORRENT_GATE9_REVIEW.md); and
9. only then resume M2 daemon integration.

The human-review checklist, submission order, issue draft, PR draft, exact
patch mapping, and reproduction commands are collected in the
[`contrib/rqbit` contribution kit](../contrib/rqbit/README.md). Nothing in that
kit has been posted upstream, and rqbit's AI policy requires human review and
editing before it is.

The two gate APIs and the metadata allocation ceiling may be designed,
reviewed, and released separately, but they are not separate permission to
start production wiring. Starting M2 with authoritative restore alone would
leave gate 7 failed and make tracker or DHT failure indistinguishable from an
ordinary lack of peers. Shipping the two gate APIs without a pre-allocation
magnet ceiling would still violate the hostile-input contract. Neither is an
accepted shortcut.

Two alternatives require an explicit ADR-19 amendment:

- disable library persistence and accept full payload hash rechecks after each
  restart, together with measured restart cost and reduced availability; or
- evaluate `libtorrent-rasterbar`, accepting its C++/FFI and packaging cost in
  exchange for the required resume and observability surface.

The later ADR-19 re-check separated M1b from this engine gate: a fake-only,
protocol-neutral queue/backend seam is useful for either engine and starts no
networking, so it may proceed under the dormant limits recorded in
[BITTORRENT_M1B_REPORT.md](BITTORRENT_M1B_REPORT.md). Until an engine path is
approved, keep `nzbd-torrent` as a tested spike boundary and do not expose a
half-wired feature flag, admission route, or peer listener.

`make gate` is the deterministic local release entry point: formatting,
strict lint, the whole workspace suite, Rust 1.85 checking, the dormant
adapter dependency boundary, the absence of `nzbd-torrent` and every
`librqbit*` package from the production daemon's normal dependency graph,
reviewed dependency exceptions, and committed fuzz seed contracts. The
`make gate-fuzz` target runs that gate first and then both bounded 20,000-case
libFuzzer campaigns by default. It requires the pinned nightly toolchain and
cargo-fuzz used by the BitTorrent fuzz workflow. The scheduled five-minute
campaigns remain separate CI evidence.

The Rust 1.85 check must select both the 1.85 Cargo and `rustc`; this host also
has a newer Homebrew compiler on `PATH`. The native platform matrix should run
in CI rather than treating missing cross-C compilers on macOS as a code result.
