# BitTorrent release review — single-node release candidate

**Status:** single-node implementation complete; consolidated review and fast
qualification remain ·
**Decision:** maintained rqbit M0 and independent review are accepted; M2–M4
are implemented on the consolidated branch and M5 owns final qualification ·
**Owner:** ADR-19 in [BITTORRENT_PROPOSAL.md](BITTORRENT_PROPOSAL.md)

This is the short operations and release-review surface for nzbd's BitTorrent
backend. It tells a reviewer what network traffic, ports, storage, seeding,
deletion, native API, and qBittorrent-compatible behavior the implementation
owns. It is not a substitute for the executable release evidence.

## 1. Decision at a glance

| Review area | Current truth | Condition for release |
|---|---|---|
| Production reachability | `[torrent].enabled = true` starts one maintained session, admission route, watch scanner, backend executor, and bounded shutdown path | Consolidated adversarial review and fast qualification must pass before merge |
| Public observability | **M0 pass** — required facts and bounded error are exposed; unavailable tracker/DHT diagnostics are explicit `unknown` | M2 state, API, and UI contract tests must preserve that honest boundary |
| Authoritative restore | Queue-authorized descriptors restore paused-first under only the configured default/category roots; pending secret sidecars reconcile independently | Restart and containment evidence remains green |
| Resource and dependency decision | **M0 pass** — accepted limits and refreshed measurements are green on all five native targets | The maintained series and accepted limits in [BITTORRENT_GATE9_REVIEW.md](BITTORRENT_GATE9_REVIEW.md) must stay green across the native matrix |
| Adversarial M5 work | In progress | The remaining resource, mounted-filesystem, production shutdown, auth-limiting, and sustained-fuzz evidence is green |
| Operator action today | Leave disabled unless the peer port, immutable payload root, seeding policy, and public-discovery implications are understood | The Settings warnings and this review agree with the running configuration |

The release decision is conjunctive. Passing one row never compensates for a
failed row, and a green workflow never changes the recorded gate state by
itself.

## 2. Public traffic

### Current boundary

The production daemon starts no peer listener, tracker client, DHT node, PEX
exchange, or payload transfer while BitTorrent is disabled. Enabling it starts
one TCP/IPv4 session with the configured port and discovery policy. Local
discovery and UPnP remain unavailable, and cluster plus torrent is rejected.

### First-release contract

| Traffic | Public v1 torrent | Private v1 torrent |
|---|---|---|
| TCP/IPv4 peers | Inbound on the configured peer port and outbound to discovered peers | Allowed only after private policy is known |
| HTTP(S) trackers | Allowed; secrets and queries stay redacted | Only the one validated metainfo tracker in the first release |
| UDP trackers | Allowed only without a SOCKS proxy | Same validation rule; proxy plus UDP fails closed |
| PEX | Enabled by default for public torrents | Disabled regardless of operator settings |
| DHT | Disabled by default; enabling it requires the accepted pre-metadata privacy policy and complete release evidence | Disabled regardless of operator settings |
| Local discovery (LSD) | Disabled by default | Disabled regardless of operator settings |
| UPnP | Unavailable | Unavailable |

An unresolved magnet is privacy-unknown. Stable rqbit cannot suppress DHT for
one add before metadata reveals the private bit, so a DHT-enabled session must
reject magnet admission rather than risk public discovery. A proxy covers
eligible TCP peer and HTTP(S) tracker traffic only; it is not a VPN kill
switch or an anonymity guarantee. Deployments that require forced routing
must enforce it in the host or container network namespace and firewall.

**Reviewer acceptance:** packet capture must show the expected public controls,
no private hash through DHT/PEX/LSD, and no direct UDP path for a proxied job.
Logs and the Settings UI must display the redacted traffic policy before a
session starts.

## 3. Ports

The first release owns exactly one explicit TCP/IPv4 peer
port, defaulting to `6881` only after the feature is deliberately enabled.
There is no port range probe, random fallback, ephemeral port, automatic
router mutation, or UPnP. Failure to bind the configured port is a startup
failure for the torrent feature, not permission to choose another port.

DHT remains off by default. A later DHT-enabled release must document its UDP
socket and egress requirements explicitly; operators must never have to infer
them from library behavior.

**Reviewer acceptance:** the startup summary, Settings UI, container examples,
and firewall guidance must agree on every inbound and outbound transport. An
upgrade with torrent support disabled must open no new socket.

## 4. Paths

The production daemon consumes `paths.torrent_dir`,
`paths.torrent_watch_dir`, and category overrides only while enabled. The
storage contract separates immutable seed payloads from the
existing completed-media destination:

| Path role | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Torrent payload root | Dedicated, canonicalized root; validated relative content only |
| Completed-media root | Existing import/post-processing destination; never silently used as the seed root |
| Category override | Must remain inside an authorized root and preserve the same portable path rules |
| *arr-visible path | The path nzbd reports must be mounted identically in nzbd and the media manager |

The adapter rejects traversal, symlinks declared by metainfo, unsafe
existing prefixes, duplicate or prefix-overlapping files, reserved Windows
names, and portable Unicode/case aliases before storage construction. The
hosted native probes describe their temporary filesystems; they do not prove
descriptor-relative containment or every filesystem used by operators.

The isolated crate-private fault harness covers two engine paths. Its write-time
proof injects storage exhaustion after one successful piece write; an
already-live filesystem-backed control must remain live across that boundary
and complete without changing the faulted torrent's state or write accounting.
The test-only seeder is rate-limited and lets rqbit bind the first available
port directly, avoiding speed-dependent and temporary-port handoff races.
Stable rqbit reports that torrent as `Error`, not the proposed disk-paused
state.

The historical initialization-time proof injected `StorageFull` from
`ensure_file_length`. Unmodified stable rqbit emits a warning log but does not
put the failure into torrent stats: a zero-byte file reports successful paused
initialization and moves to `Live` on resume without a stats error or retry
before that observation. The
[2026-08-13 replacement run](https://github.com/pjunod/nzbd/actions/runs/31654021866)
reproduced it on all five native targets with one 262,144-byte sizing request,
a zero-byte file, zero piece writes, and no stats-visible error. The daemon now
has a protocol-neutral multi-root enforcing guard, cluster placement hold, and
local/per-node limiting-volume status, but neither proof routes a torrent fault
into it. They therefore do not establish operator-visible torrent ENOSPC
behavior and do not authorize production wiring.

Maintained stable patch `0018` propagates the first selected-file sizing error
out of initialization, with an exact unit proof and mutation-sensitivity
check. The current-main contribution variant also distinguishes typed checksum
cancellation from real I/O failure so an overlapping pause cannot hide storage
exhaustion. The maintained fix closes the engine fail-open boundary; it does
not replace M2's required torrent fault-routing, pause, and recovery policy.
The native harness now treats the historical `Paused`-then-`Live` result as a
failure: admission or initialization must expose the bounded file, length, and
storage cause, and any asynchronously returned handle must enter `Error`.

**Reviewer acceptance:** supported deployment examples must exercise the
actual bind mounts or volumes, case/normalization behavior, low-space guard,
symlink race boundary, import path, and restart authority. Until that matrix
is green, adapter path preflight is defense in depth rather than an operator
mount guarantee.

## 5. Seeding

The queue owner checkpoints cumulative uploaded bytes and seeding time, applies
per-add → category → global limits at exact boundaries, and pauses without
deleting payloads.

The first-release contract marks a verified torrent `ready` while it may still
seed. The default seed ratio and seed time are unlimited until the caller or
operator chooses a limit; nzbd must warn about an unlimited active seed rather
than invent a potentially tracker-hostile default. Reaching a ratio or time
limit pauses seeding and retains data. It never silently deletes payloads or
races the media manager's import.

Upload limits, achieved ratio/time, current upload rate, and paused-seed state
must be visible through the native API/UI and the supported qBittorrent
compatibility projection. Private tracker policy remains authoritative.

**Reviewer acceptance:** docs and examples must distinguish readiness,
seeding, paused seeding, import, and removal. A seed-limit test must prove that
the payload still exists and that explicit resume or removal remains possible.

## 6. Deletion

Deletion is always an explicit caller choice after the torrent handle is
stopped:

| Operation | Control-plane result | Payload result |
|---|---|---|
| Forget, keep data | Remove live metadata/control and write terminal history | Retain the validated payload and report its location |
| Forget, delete data | Remove live metadata/control and write terminal history | Remove only the persisted, authorized torrent content |

The isolated adapter proves idempotent keep/delete calls and retention of an
unrelated sibling. That is not the complete production proof: the durable job
must own the authoritative delete root, restart reconciliation must not widen
it, open handles must be stopped, and every refusal or partial failure must be
visible. A seed limit never implies either deletion operation.

**Reviewer acceptance:** restart, missing-file, symlink, external-move,
read-only, and partial-delete cases must leave honest history and must never
remove a sibling, parent, completed-media import, or path outside the durable
root.

## 7. Release evidence

Run the deterministic gate before every review:

```sh
make gate
```

Run the bounded local fuzz campaigns when the pinned nightly toolchain is
available:

```sh
make gate-fuzz
```

The release reviewer also checks the native and security evidence rather than
relying on one local host:

|---|---|

These links are evidence snapshots, not evergreen approval. The reviewed
commit must have its own green required checks.

## 8. Sign-off and stop conditions

Before any production wiring PR can be approved, the reviewer records all of
the following:

- All eleven M0 gates pass for the exact maintained engine on every supported
  native target, with checksum/series/vendor integrity and independent review.
- Gate 9's resource ceilings, measurements, and dependency exceptions remain
  accepted and enforced.
- The remaining M5 resource, filesystem, shutdown, auth, and sustained-fuzz
  work is executable and green.
- Public/private captures match §2 and every port is visible before startup.
- Supported operator mounts pass the path, disk-full, restart, and deletion
  matrix.
- Seed limits pause without deleting, while explicit keep/delete behavior is
  correct and visible.
- Disabled upgrades open no peer socket and admit no torrent.
- Rollback and downgrade drain/export steps have been exercised.

This document's drift check pins the selected maintained engine, the
eleven-gate M0 evidence, and the active single-node boundary. Any future engine,
network, cluster, or compatibility expansion must update the proposal, M0
report, this review, and the check together. Bypassing the check is not a
substitute for that decision.
